## Usage Guide

### 1. Running the Analysis
Steps 1, 2, 3 and 4 are all achieved by running all in the .ipynb file.

To guarantee that your environment is compatible, run the following in your terminal:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    
    ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code.ipynb

### 2: Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
The data is successfully extracted, transformed and loaded into a dataframe before exporting to csv.

### 3: Create the Campaign DataFrame
The data is successfully extracted, transformed and loaded into a dataframe before exporting to csv.

### 4: Create the Contacts DataFrame
Both options were developed to extract, transform and load into a dataframe before exporting to csv.

### 5: Create the Crowdfunding Database
Make your database in pgAdmin and use the provided sql code to create the tables. Once the tables are created, import the respective csv files for each table in the order in which they were added. Then run the 'Select' lines to see the full display of the database.


## Technologies Used
This project leverages several technologies to process and analyze election data efficiently:

- **Python**: The primary scripting language used for analysis, providing powerful tools for automation and data handling.
- **Pandas**: A versatile library for data manipulation and cleaning, essential for organizing and analyzing datasets.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment to explore, visualize, and document the data analysis process.
- **Visual Studio Code**: A feature-rich IDE for writing, debugging, and managing project files efficiently.
- **GitHub**: An online platform for repository hosting, collaboration, and maintaining project documentation.
